			Hellow! Welcome to our warm and comforting pet shop where you can come pet our loving dogs or buy a pet! Our company sells and ships animals such as dogs, cats and goldfish worldwide. We also distribute domestic animals such as flamingoes and monkeys. What is great about our family pet shop is that we have the necessary equipment that is essential to the animal you are taking care of and loving. Such as aquariums and fishtanks for your nemo fish and angel fish, and cages for your jaguars and leopards, and artificial trees for your sloths.
